###About Me

I am a Front-End Engineering Student at the Iron Yard, learning to apply technology to the things I care about and expanding my world. At the College of St. Scholastica, I earned a Bachelor's with a double major in Spanish and general biology, with the Webster Scholar (Honors program) and _Summa Cum Laude_ distinctions. After graduation, I served with Minnesota Reading Corps. My dedication and my insight into my students' needs allowed me to boost **three times** as many students to program completion as a typical Reading Corps tutor. My excellent performance also led to praise from Superintendent _emeritus_ Dan Hooverman and a paid position with Mounds View Schools. It is now time for me to move forward and continue challenging myself.

###My Hobbies
**Poetry**- I am a published poet, having had three poems as well as a short story published in _The Freshwater Review_. Here is an excerpt from my poem _Benvolio_:

> At the stoplight just before Highway 23 barrels on  
> forever  
> through fields where neither trees nor soybeans grow  
> (just dead, dead grass)  
> four buildings stand. Three have clean walls and lawns  
> with dirt streaks showing  
> the sod that has not yet taken.  
>
> The fourth, a quarter-century back, sold  tractors. Now  
> the walls are worn the grass is brown,
> and inside of it, there is life. I left
> Benvolio  
> there because he had the runs for months but  we had  
> to show the house. The small animal vet in her  
> neat little office downtown  
> threw up her hands which is why I brought him  
> to the pig-doctor.

**Technology**- Solving problems by creating new programs is so exciting. At this time, I am learning:

   * HTML5   
   * CSS
   * JavaScript

**Tae Kwon Do**- Believe it or not, I have a _Kukkiwon_-recognized first degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.
